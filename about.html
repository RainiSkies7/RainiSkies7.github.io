                hi! i'm lily! i am an 18 year old trans bunny (she/her pronouns, please <3) and an aspiring (and bad ;-;) artist/cartoonist. i am SHY AS HECK!!! my dream is to one day make my very own cartoon! but for now i'm sticking to making comics since that is more realistic for someone on their own. i'm not very good at drawing, but i like to think that i am improving!<br><br>

                i've always been very intrigued by 90s/early 2000s style websites, and i wanted to make my own! so i did! i don't remember too much about these old style sites, but i must've visited some of them. i specifically remember old youtube and homestar runner, among other things.<br><br>
                
                i wanted to host this on neocities since i thought it would fit in, but i already had this domain and i wanted to use it, so i went with github pages instead, since i didn't need a premium account to use my own domain.<br><br>
